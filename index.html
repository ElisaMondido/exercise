	<h1> ABOUT US </h1>
		<p> Here at Café-UK, hooking you up with your daily dose of freshly vacuum-brewed “energy in a cup” isn’t just our priority but we strive to be your #1 go-to place for your caffeine fix. Our three storey café is decked with a multitude of bar stools, cushioned chairs, couches, electric outlets, and (drum rolls please…) 60 x 100 cm drafting tables for those who need to do their plates while enjoying their own cup of joe. Plus we also have a naturally ventilated smoking lounge. Did we mention we embedded iPad units in our café tables too? Still not good enough for you? How ’bout we top that off with free 10 mbps Wi-Fi. Time to say goodbye to the hassles of buffering. </p>
